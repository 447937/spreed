# Nextcloud Talk

**Video- & audio-conferencing app for Nextcloud**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/spreed/master/docs/call-in-action.png)

## Why is this so awesome?

* :speech_balloon: **Chat integration!** Nextcloud Talk comes with some simple text chat since Nextcloud 13. More features are planned for future versions.
* :busts_in_silhouette: **Private, group, public and password protected calls!** Just invite somebody, a whole group or send a public link to invite to a call.
* :computer: **Screen sharing!** Share your screen with participants of your call. You just need to use Firefox version 52 (or newer) or Chrome with this [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screensharing-for-nextclo/kepnpjhambipllfmgmbapncekcmabkol).
* :rocket: **Integration with other Nextcloud apps!** Currently Contacts and users – more to come.
* :see_no_evil: **We’re not reinventing the wheel!** Based on the great [simpleWebRTC](https://simplewebrtc.com/) library.

And in the works for the [coming versions](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/milestones/):
* :raising_hand: [Federated calls](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues/21), to call people on other Nextclouds

If you have suggestions or problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues) or contribute directly :)

### Supported Browsers

Firefox | Chrome/Chromium | Edge | Safari | Opera
---|---|---|---|---
✔️ 52 or later | ✔️ 49 or later | ⏳ [Planned](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues/687) | ⏳ [Planned](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues/687) | ❌ Not planned yet


### Installing

Nextcloud Talk is really easy to install. You just need to enable the app from the [Nextcloud App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/spreed) and everything will work out of the box.

There are some scenarios (users behind strict firewalls / symmetric NATs) where a TURN server is needed. That's a bit more tricky installation, but the guys from [Nextcloud VM](https://github.com/nextcloud/vm) have developed a script which takes care of everything for you. You can find the script [here](https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/blob/master/apps/talk.sh). The script is tested on Ubuntu Server 18.04, but should work on 16.04 as well. Please keep in mind that it's developed for the VM specifically and any issues should be reported in that repo, not here.

Here's a short [video](https://youtu.be/KdTsWIy4eN0) on how it's done.

### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as a additional safeguard
for the Nextcloud project. This is a well established and widely used
mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license
their contribution under the project's license.
Please read [developer-certificate-of-origin][dcofile].
If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

````
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
````

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).
If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)
like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with
`git ci` and the commit will be signed.
